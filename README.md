# htmlToPDFdirTree
takes an exported html file from a browser and outputs URLs to PDFs while maintaining directory structure.
I used bookmarks2fs for most of the code and added a couple lines of code using pdfkit. There are issues with certain websites (xda, howtogeek both owned by Valnet Publishing) that cause the script to stall. I haven't taken the time to deal with it, if I'm even capable of actually fixing it.
